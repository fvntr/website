## Development

### Installation

```bash
npm i
```

This will install all the packages needed to run this website locally.

### Service Worker

The [service worker](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) is being initialized in `site/layouts/partials/scripts/service-worker.html` and is included in the `.gitignore`.

Make sure to comment out this file before running the live server.

### Live Server

```bash
npm start
```

This will automatically open a browser tab with the website and BrowserSync will automatically reload the CSS or refresh the whole page, when stylesheets or content changes.

Our pipeline is inspired by [Victor Hugo](https://github.com/netlify-templates/victor-hugo) which is a Hugo boilerplate for creating truly epic websites.

```

## Deployment

```bash
npm run build
```

This will build a static version of the website inside the `/dist` folder.

This command is not generally needed for local development as it is just used to handle deployments through Netlify - see `netlify.toml`.
